# Lightning Address

### **Like an email address, but for money.**

## General Information

The Lightning Address is an [Internet Identifier](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322#section-3.4.1) that allows anyone to send you Bitcoin over the Lightning Network. No scanning of QR codes or pasting invoices necessary.

For more information check out the website: [lightningaddress.com](https://lightningaddress.com)

## Developers

If you are a developer aiming to introduce support for Lightning Addresses in your application, wallet, check the [DIY](./DIY.md) section.

## Bridge Server

If you don't want to roll out an entire HTTP / LNURL server on your own setup/infrastructure, but already have a Lightning node you want to use for your Lightning Address? Check the [Bridge Server](./BRIDGE.md) for a plug-n-play solution.

## TLDR

Here's a quick primer on how Lightning Address works and how it relies on the [LNURL Pay protocol](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/master/lnurl-pay.md).
